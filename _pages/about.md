I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science in the [Department of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Hawaii at Manoa](https://www.ics.hawaii.edu/) (expected graduation Summer 2023).
My research interests span the areas of high-performance computing, parallel algorithms, cache-efficient algorithms, and general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU).
